The <meta> tags provide metadata about the HTML document, which can be used by search engines to understand 
the content of the page better. Metadata such as the description can influence click-through rates from 
search engine results.

The use of <section> and <nav> elements helps to define the structure and outline of the document, making it 
easier for search engines to parse and index the content effectively. This structural clarity can contribute 
to better SEO by ensuring that the content hierarchy is recognized by search engines.

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It involves the process of optimizing a website
 to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to the business in search engines.
The importance of SEO lies in its ability to help drive more organic (non-paid) traffic to a site, which can lead 
to increased brand awareness, higher sales, and growth. Effective SEO strategies improve a website's ranking 
in search engine results pages (SERPs), making it more likely that potential customers will see and click on 
the site.
